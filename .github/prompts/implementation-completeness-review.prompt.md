Follow the project standards in [copilot-instructions](../copilot-instructions.md).

Review the provided feature, code, diff, or implementation with a strict completeness standard.

Assess whether the work is actually complete across:
- User entry points and discovery surfaces
- Destination pages, dialogs, panels, and linked flows
- Backend, API, storage, and state wiring
- Navigation and deep links between related surfaces
- Loading, empty, error, success, offline, and disabled states
- Permissions, validation, and edge cases
- Operational controls needed to manage created content
- Verification appropriate to the change

Use this rule: a visible feature is not complete unless the surrounding user experience and expected follow-up actions are also complete.

Example standard:
- If a header notifications feature exists, verify the icon, badge, dropdown or panel, read vs unread distinction, list presentation, mark all as read, deep links to relevant content, and a fully wired notifications page with management actions such as mark as read, archive, delete, select all, and delete all.

Output format:
1. Verdict: `Ready`, `Not Ready`, or `Blocked`
2. Findings: list the gaps or risks that prevent the work from being truly complete, ordered by impact
3. Missing supporting flows and states: call out anything implied by the feature but not actually implemented
4. Verification gaps: note missing tests, manual validation, or runtime checks
5. Open blockers or assumptions: only if they materially affect readiness

Review rules:
- Findings come first
- Do not accept backend-only or UI-only slices as complete when the feature clearly requires both
- Flag placeholder controls, dead-end navigation, or missing management actions
- If no major gaps are found, say that explicitly and note any residual risk
- Ask only the minimum clarifying questions needed to judge completeness
